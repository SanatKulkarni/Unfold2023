Experience the future of event booking with CryptoBookings - where convenience meets speed in the world of blockchain.

# Problem Statement
CryptoBookings is a pioneering web3-based booking platform that aims to revolutionize the ticket purchasing and refund process. The problem it addresses is the delay and inconvenience users face when withdrawing tickets on traditional platforms, where the refund process involves waiting for days for the organizer and the bank to process it. CryptoBookings offers an innovative solution where, upon ticket withdrawal, the refund is immediately deposited into the user’s account, providing a seamless and efficient user experience. This immediate transaction process sets CryptoBookings apart from other platforms, making it a game-changer in the event booking industry.


# Technologies Used:
- Avalanche Fuji C-Chain: It’s a component of the Avalanche network designed for running smart contracts compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine1.
- React: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces2.
- NextJS: A React framework that provides structure, features, and optimizations for web applications3.
- ThirdWeb: A platform providing tools for creators to easily build, launch, and manage Web3 projects4.
- Solidity: A statically typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine5.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces6.
- sWithPaper zkLogin: A Sui primitive that lets users send transactions from a Sui address using an OAuth credential, without publicly linking the two7.


# Features Added:
- Smart Contract Ticketing: Implement a smart contract system for ticket sales and refunds. This ensures transparency and trust, as all transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
- Real-Time Availability: Show real-time ticket availability for events. This feature can help users make quick decisions and improve their booking experience.
- User Reviews and Ratings: Allow users to rate and review events they’ve attended. This can help future attendees make informed decisions.
- Personalized Recommendations: Based on user’s past bookings and preferences, the DApp could provide personalized event recommendations.\
- Loyalty Rewards: Implement a loyalty program where users earn crypto tokens for every booking made. These tokens could be used for discounts on future bookings or exclusive access to certain events.


# Challenges Faced:
- Varying Versions: One of the major challenges is dealing with varying versions of the technology. This can lead to compatibility issues and errors, requiring constant updates and maintenance to ensure     
  smooth operation.
- Blockchain Scalability: The scalability of the blockchain can be a challenge. As the number of transactions increases, it can lead to slower transaction times and higher costs. The Avalanche Subnet that this 
  contract will be working on would need to be able to handle high amount of transactions especially during popular events and rush hours.
- Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring compliance with different regulatory frameworks across various jurisdictions can be complex and challenging.
- User Adoption: Convincing users to adopt a new technology, especially one as relatively complex as blockchain, can be difficult. It requires significant efforts in user education and interface design to ensure   a smooth user experience. This is why CryptoBookings implements zK-Login through which users are familiar with the transactions as the complex layer is hidden behind the zK-transactions.
- Security: While blockchain is inherently secure, the interfaces used to interact with it (like wallets and browsers) may not be. Ensuring end-to-end security can be a significant challenge. CryptoBookings 
  solves this by using audited openzepplin contracts on the blockchain side, and best security practices on the frontend side.


# Future Prospects: 
- **Avalanche Integration:** We aim to implement our platform on Avalanche subnets. This will enhance the security of our transactions, improve scalability, and speed 
  up transaction times, providing a superior user experience.
- **Enhanced zK-Login Process:** We are committed to improving the security and user-friendliness of the zK-Login process. This will ensure a seamless and secure login 
  experience for our users.
- **Marketing and Integration:** Our marketing strategy involves both organic and mainstream channels to reach a wider audience. We are also working towards enabling 
  companies and governments to integrate with our DApp, expanding its usability and reach.
- **User Education:** To ensure the successful adoption of our platform, we plan to invest in user education. This includes creating resources to help users understand 
  how to use our DApp effectively and safely.
- **Partnerships:** We are exploring partnerships with event organizers and ticketing platforms. This will allow us to offer a wider range of events on our platform, 
  enhancing the value proposition for our users.
